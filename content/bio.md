Hi, I’m Shani Elharrar, a software engineer and R&D group lead based in Israel. I work mainly on backend systems and distributed data processing. I enjoy solving real-world engineering problems, especially around performance, scalability, and clean architecture.

I currently lead engineering efforts at Upsolver, where we build data lake infrastructure and streaming pipelines. I’ve worked with languages like Scala (❤️), Kotlin, and C#, and I’m especially interested in profiling, observability, and making systems easier to reason about.

I'm available @ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanielh/), or by email at **shani _at_ handsonculture _dot_ blog**
